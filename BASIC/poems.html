                  <p>
                    This is what I promised you: a driftwood fire in winter.
                  </p>
                  <p>So when dusk plunged the cove into shadow,</p>
                  <p>and the tides dragged evening ashore,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I cobbled bundles of sea-strewn wreckage</p>
                  <p>from the stony beach and lugged them</p>
                  <p>
                    back:the salt-bleached bones of spruce and oak,shards of
                    lobster trap, the
                  </p>
                  <p>broken ribs of ketchand trawler,</p>
                  <p>
                    splinters of spar and yawl,stem, sprit and keel— the wrackof
                    a continent
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    sundered and driven shorewardin the Atlantic’s mythic pound.
                    What the
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    seastossed up, I gathered for us and hauled home.So, we
                    travel far tonight, my
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    dear mariner,on this raft of sea-smoke, before this
                    driftwoodfire of our making,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    the one I built for you.Then let me stroke your hair as we
                    moorin love’s familiar
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Every stone tells a story.</p>
                  <p>I’m sure of it. Lay your head</p>
                  <p>against a stone. Listen</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>as it utters its histories:</p>
                  <p>how it once ground an ax,</p>
                  <p>marked the grave of a child,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>traveled miles in the boot</p>
                  <p>of a soldier retreating</p>
                  <p>from Moscow then sunk</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>into the muck of a river</p>
                  <p>like a star. Water flows</p>
                  <p>around it, pouring</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>over its inscrutable armature,</p>
                  <p>the stone bowing in supplication.</p>
                  <p>(That’s the way it is with stones.)</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Every stone tells a story.</p>
                  <p>Yours is still out there,</p>
                  <p>waiting for you. Choose a stone</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>but by evening leave it at the bend</p>
                  <p>in the road to mark the place</p>
                  <p>where you got lost,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>or drop it into your pocket</p>
                  <p>for luck if nothing else.</p>

                  <p>Go out and gather stones</p>
                  <p>when it’s raining,</p>
                  <p>on a day when a single gesture</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>anchors the world, and a stone</p>
                  <p>reflects the deeper contemplation</p>
                  <p>of whoever cradles it,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>shining and wet in his palm.</p>
                  <p>Its silence is of men</p>
                  <p>who have fished too long,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>of hunters who return home</p>
                  <p>through bare trees.</p>
                  <p>Lover of animals, namer of stars,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>choose a stone, dense with the weight</p>
                  <p>of an unanswered question.</p>
                  <p>Plunge it into a lake</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>where the dark surface</p>
                  <p>has been smoothed by cold.</p>
                  <p>The world shudders in its absence</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>which the widening rings</p>
                  <p>quietly confirm.</p>

                  <p>When children ask if it’s frightening</p>
                  <p>when they come alive, I tell them yes,</p>
                  <p>of course it is, it’s absolutely terrifying,</p>
                  <p>and believe me, you don’t want to be around</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>when it happens, especially at night.</p>
                  <p>When they ask if the mummies walk</p>
                  <p>with their arms outstretched like mummies</p>
                  <p>in the movies, I tell them no, it’s nothing</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>like that. You see, I explain, the muscles</p>
                  <p>of their arms have atrophied from thousands</p>
                  <p>of years of disuse; they just can’t walk</p>
                  <p>around the way mummies do in movies.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>In fact, I explain, their feet have been so</p>
                  <p>lovingly and carefully bound by strips</p>
                  <p>of linen, that it’s difficult for them</p>
                  <p>to walk at all which explains the halting</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>gait, the fear that at any moment they will stumble</p>
                  <p>and pitch forward, landing in a heap of rags.</p>
                  <p>Can they talk? No, they can’t talk, not after</p>
                  <p>all those years in tombs choked with the dust</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>of centuries and the weight of eternity</p>
                  <p>upon them. Can they see, they want to know.</p>
                  <p>Not any more, I say, for their eyes</p>
                  <p>were replaced with onions or stones,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>stones as white as the sun. Finally, I explain,</p>
                  <p>they long only to wander forth as they used to,</p>
                  <p>so long ago and once again admire their reflections</p>
                  <p>in the shimmering Nile of the gallery floor.</p>

                  <p>Under spring stars,</p>
                  <p>he touched my face and breasts</p>
                  <p>and the innumerable moons of my body.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>For months, I listened for him</p>
                  <p>everywhere, hearing his laugh now and again</p>
                  <p>down stone corridors or across the hushed drifts</p>
                  <p>that chilled Elsinore.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>And once only did I find him,</p>
                  <p>that shadow darkening his strange brow</p>
                  <p>talking to the players in whispers</p>
                  <p>in a cold chamber.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>My refuge, then, was the childhood willow</p>
                  <p>where I climbed and sang clear</p>
                  <p>above the brook.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>And when I descended into the arms</p>
                  <p>of the water, I turned slowly</p>
                  <p>listening with eyelashes, fingertips,</p>
                  <p>one arm thrown out to the current</p>
                  <p>that swallowed me like snow.</p>

                  <p>Brew me cowboy coffee, boiled</p>
                  <p>over a mesquite fire, an egg—</p>
                  <p>yoke and shell—tossed in</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>to sink the grounds like ore,</p>
                  <p>one eye on the pre-dawn star,</p>
                  <p>the other squinting against the smoke.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p>on sea-going freighters, the typesetter who pours</p>
                  <p>over his leaden glyphs at 4:00 am, those who weld,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>pound, rivet and saw, march, write or groan</p>
                  <p>with hangover. I want the coal-black brew</p>
                  <p>of miners and cab-drivers, those of the third shift,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>those who burn the midnight oil, burn the candle</p>
                  <p>at both ends, put their backs into it, their shoulders</p>
                  <p>to the wheel and their noses to the grindstone.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I long for the smoky, bituminous espressos</p>
                  <p>of the Mediterranean, or Viennese—</p>
                  <p>the dense, meditative brew of the firebrand</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>and the pamphleteer. I crave Arabica, high and airy,</p>
                  <p>smoky Kenyan or earthen Guatemalan: pods</p>
                  <p>charred to voltage then ground to dust</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>by the weight of the world; one sip</p>
                  <p>and you quiver like an apiary. Pour me</p>
                  <p>the rough coffee of shepherds, brewed</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>over a turf fire as autumn stars plunge</p>
                  <p>behind the hills. And at the end of the trail,</p>
                  <p>I want a tin cup of joe largely qualified</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>with a slug of whisky. And as I hunch over my piping</p>
                  <p>mug, steam rising like gratitude, I’ll spend</p>
                  <p>the hours considering my options,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>no other tasks before me but liberating</p>
                  <p>the proletariat or once again watching dawn</p>
                  <p>rip through the rim of another day</p>

                    bogwater fills the circuits and the angered technicians are
                    out on country roads checking the lines for trouble. In your
                    living room, the panicked cables have stopped coming in and
                    the screen is clogged once again with the dust of the sea.
                    Once more, the television is just a stone blinking into
                    heavy rain. Suddenly the whole room flares in the drizzle.
                    The television snares whatever animals haven't yet climbed
                    trees, apologizes to whoever is still hiding under the bed,
                    and calmly nails your nightmares like a coin to the mast of
                    a ship in an electrical storm. The Arctic and sub-Arctic
                    continents are ablaze. I could go on but it's raining on the
                    TV now, the static raining like a plague. Try now to switch
                    off the tube and jump into bed before the snow starts
                    falling.

                  <p>Even beforehand the questions started:</p>
                  <p>How many angels? How many reincarnations?</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Only the one God? Where</p>
                  <p>is the afterlife? How about potatoes?</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Coffee? Are there green vales and good pasture?</p>
                  <p>Boogie-woogie piano?</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Was it somewhere to go, like smoke,</p>
                  <p>when you drifted up through sleep?</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>One day, martins darted on high winds</p>
                  <p>in the blue void between two sudden worlds,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>incomprehensible, without measure.</p>
                  <p>Then heaven became a place</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>to lie down in for an hour,</p>
                  <p>with the long summer sun on our faces,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>amid the drone of bees in a tended garden,</p>
                  <p>and above us the vitreous savannas of cloud.</p>

                  <h3 class="title">THE GREAT HORNED OWL’S MONOLOGUE</h3>
                  <p>Daylight scarred the water. Scalded in afternoon’s</p>
                  <p>fiery cauldron, I retreated into the timber, spurs</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    stropped on the thin air. Now I trawl the shadows,
                    eternity’s insomniac,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    implacable executioner to the blundering vole, the
                    inconsequential mice.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    In the light of jagged moons I pluck the meek and the
                    foolish,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    asking my insoluble questions, claws poised for a wrong
                    answer.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    My spoils bleed. Bones lowered from the beak’s meat hook
                  </p>
                  <p>improve my midden. Neck swiveling, obdurate sockets</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>sweeping the horizon, every twitch snugged</p>
                  <p>in the eye’s yellow noose. When the naked hare blinks,</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>I gather the small ghost of its heart into my talons.</p>
                  <p>The snow is just killing time. My mask is calm.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>In my icy hood I hear everything.</p>
                  <p>The red star bruises my shoulder.</p>
