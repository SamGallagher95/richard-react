                      Elizabeth Jorgensen teaches English at Arrowhead Union
                      High School. Since 2008, students in her junior- and
                      senior-level Creative Writing classes have submitted to
                      the Milwaukee Public Museum&rsquo;s annual poetry
                      competition. Poet and essayist Richard Hedderman is the
                      Education Programs Coordinator at the Milwaukee Public
                      Museum. He is the Coordinator and Lead Judge for the
                      Museum&rsquo;s annual Student Poetry Competition. In this
                      article, Hedderman, discusses his approach to evaluating
                      the poems as they&rsquo;re submitted, while Jorgensen
                      provides a classroom perspective.

                      Looking for a way to energize my classroom with authentic
                      writing opportunities, I scour websites, newspapers and
                      online announcements for student-friendly writers&rsquo;
                      markets. Although I could formulate a hypothetical
                      audience for my classroom writing assignments, I find
                      student motivation increases with authentic opportunities.
                      Having students submit to writers&rsquo; markets
                      isn&rsquo;t any more work than an assignment that stays in
                      the classroom and writers&rsquo; markets facilitate my
                      pedagogical goals.

                      One Wisconsin-wide writers&rsquo; market is the Milwaukee
                      Public Museum&rsquo;s annual poetry competition. Now in
                      its tenth year, the competition is open to Wisconsin
                      students in grades three through 12. The competition fits
                      naturally inside Wisconsin English or social studies
                      curricula as students are challenged to compose a poem in
                      30 lines or less as a response to the Museum&rsquo;s
                      permanent or temporary exhibits, collections or fields of
                      research.

                      Though poems are commonly submitted by English and

                      The Museum launched the program with its first competition
                      in 2008. Early the previous year, Museum staff were in the
                      planning stages for a traveling exhibition on the Titanic,
                      and brainstorming ideas for innovative programming to
                      support it, when a brilliant and charming Education staff
                      member suggested a poetry competition for students. So,
                      that first year, the theme was &ldquo;the Titanic, ships
                      and shipwrecks,&rdquo; and hundreds of student poems
                      poured in from schools around the state. The winners were
                      invited to read their poems at the museum on May 18th that
                      year, which is International Museum Day, and a poster
                      featuring their winning poems was displayed in the
                      exhibition for the remainder of its run. The program was a
                      success, and the Museum&rsquo;s Education Department
                      adopted it as a permanent feature of its regular education
                      programming, engaging students in the exploration of the
                      Museum and its exhibits and collections through the
                      application of creative language arts.

                      Subsequent themes continue to align closely with the
                      Museum&rsquo;s exhibits and collections. The year
                      following the Titanic competition, the theme was
                      &ldquo;Excavating the Soul&mdash;the Poetry of
                      Archaeology,&rdquo; which connected with the
                      Museum&rsquo;s first hosting of the Milwaukee chapter of
                      the Archaeological Institute of America&rsquo;s
                      archaeology fair. The next year, the traveling exhibition,
                      &ldquo;Mummies of the World,&rdquo; inspired a number of
                      wonderful student poems. The theme &ldquo;Objects and
                      Artifacts&mdash;the Poetry of the Museum&rsquo;s
                      Collections,&rdquo; spanned both the 2012 and 2013
                      competitions owing to the richness of the Museum&rsquo;s
                      collections. Students were encouraged to choose a favorite
                      or interesting object on exhibit during a visit to the
                      museum, or select one from a virtual collection of the
                      Museum&rsquo;s artifacts and specimens available online.
                      Subsequent themes included &ldquo;journeys,&rdquo;
                      &ldquo;animals,&rdquo; &ldquo;ancient worlds,&rdquo; and
                      &ldquo;food,&rdquo; among others.

                        does the Museum assignment motivate students to write
                        for an audience and analyze other poems for structure
                        and meaning, but the competition also aligns with the
                        Wisconsin State and Common Core standards. Specifically,
                        the standard on Production and Distribution of Writing
                        states students should &ldquo;produce clear and coherent
                        writing in which the development, organization, and
                        style are appropriate to task, purpose, and
                        audience...develop and strengthen writing as needed by
                        planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new
                        approach&hellip;[and] use technology, including the
                        Internet, to produce and publish writing and to interact
                        and collaborate with others.&rdquo;

                        theoretical audience, the MPM&rsquo;s poetry competition
                        provides students with authenticity across grade levels.

                      Void of a rubric, students&rsquo; poems are &ldquo;judged
                      on creativity, originality, imagery, artistic quality, and
                      sense of poetic expression.&rdquo; But what do these terms
                      mean? To begin, I have students read the contest
                      guidelines and create their own definitions of the judging
                      criteria. Students connect &ldquo;imagery&rdquo; to
                      showing, instead of telling. They define &ldquo;artistic
                      quality&rdquo; as &ldquo;how a poem is like art.&rdquo;
                      Students agree effective art evokes an emotion and makes
                      the viewer (or in this case, reader) think or feel
                      differently. Creativity, students decide, is something
                      that makes one submission stand out from the others, and
                      students surmise that of the hundreds of statewide
                      submissions, theirs will need to not only address the
                      theme, but also be original. Throughout the discussion, I
                      jot down notes for students to access later. This
                      discussion helps them form an imaginary guideline of their
                      own. &nbsp;

                      To further guide the writing process, students read and

                      how the poems fit the judging criteria.

                      I ask the students what they notice. &ldquo;There is a
                      story,&rdquo; one student says. We discuss how Suhan drew
                      inspiration from a museum artifact (Dresden Tete-a-Tete
                      Tea Set) and used her own creativity and voice to tell an
                      original story that fits with the authenticity of the
                      artifact.

                      One student highlights the characters, themes and
                      conclusion in &ldquo;Porcelain Deathbed.&rdquo; Another
                      student says she notices &ldquo;interesting language
                      choices.&rdquo; I push for specifics and the students say
                      they notice the rule of thirds in the line &ldquo;smiling,
                      content and free,&rdquo; and action

                      the semester, students learned about stylistic devices and
                      literary terms. This discussion carries throughout the MPM
                      poetry competition. And no matter the writing assignment,
                      students learn to identify stylistic devices and
                      purposeful writing choices in exemplars and utilize them
                      in their own work.

                      &ldquo;Her structure is strong,&rdquo; another student
                      says. Students note six lines in each stanza, each line
                      contains six syllables, and a repeating sixth line. While
                      students comment on the use of enjambment and emotion, I
                      continue adding notes to our brainstormed list.

                      Students analyze the story, the structure (how lines build

                        submitted to the competition is how it is framed,
                        formatted and presented. So, there&rsquo;s a
                        responsibility incumbent on the teacher to be very
                        attentive to the submission guidelines. I need to see
                        the student&rsquo;s name, the teacher&rsquo;s name,
                        grade level taught, and his or her full contact
                        information in the top right corner of the page. If I
                        don&rsquo;t see that, my confidence in the poem plummets
                        before I&rsquo;ve even read it. And colored paper,
                        illustrations and decorative fonts are just distracting,
                        and never do anything to make the poem more appealing or
                        more likely to win. And if the poem is longer than 30
                        lines, you&rsquo;ve lost me before I even read it, which
                        I may not do. This might all seem a little fussy and
                        bureaucratic, but it&rsquo;s critical; it tells me how
                        much care has been put into the submission. If the
                        teachers and students don&rsquo;t care intensely about
                        the work, then neither will I.</font

                        some to think that creativity equals sloppiness, which
                        is a very poor argument. Creativity may be the impulse
                        behind the poem&mdash;and that impulse can, and probably
                        should be, sloppy, messy and disorganized. But structure
                        reflects craft, and craft gives the poem meaning and
                        impact. That&rsquo;s what makes it art.</font

                        Otherwise, I get the impression that the writer just
                        walked away from his poem instead of putting in the work
                        necessary to make it a cohesive and integrated work of
                        art. Yeats said that a good poem &ldquo;comes right with

                        but an emotion, observation, comparison, perspective.
                        I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of student poems composed of a
                        list of facts about the subject. This won&rsquo;t
                        disqualify a poem, but the list of facts need something
                        unusual, something innovative&mdash;a
                        twist&mdash;something the poet is telling me about his
                        relationship with them that I can&rsquo;t find by just
                        googling &ldquo;the Titanic,&rdquo; or
                        &ldquo;mummies,&rdquo; for example. I&rsquo;ll also give
                        a poem a lot of credit for a bit of humor. Poetry
                        doesn&rsquo;t have to be serious all the time, and
                        certainly doesn&rsquo;t need to be serious to be good. I
                        really appreciate a laugh in a poem. &ldquo;Crummy
                        Mummy,&rdquo; is a great example of a funny, successful
                        poem.</font

                      Each of these is a winning poem from the competition. Note
                      the attention to detail, the strong sense of voice and
                      investment from the writer. Each of these poems features a
                      vivid, transformative power that involves the reader in
                      the poet&rsquo;s discovery of new terrain.

                        easy to do, but when a student writer accomplishes it in
                        a poem, that poem goes immediately to the top of my
                        &ldquo;potential&rdquo; pile, as opposed to the top of
                        the &ldquo;nope&rdquo; pile. And I like to see poems
                        that stay linked to their theme&mdash;and to the
                        writer&rsquo;s voice, emotion and impulse&mdash;all the
                        way through, something else that&rsquo;s tough to do.
                        For me, the poem has to hang together and stay together.
                        A poem needs a spine&mdash;a through-line, an adherence
                        to theme&mdash;that its various parts attach to so that
                        it stays together as a coherent, artistic unit. Again,
                        this is not easy. Not for professional poets, let alone
                        students who are maybe trying to write a poem for the

                      After we collaboratively analyze previous winning poems, I
                      provide students independent work time to immerse
                      themselves in the MPM Poetry Competition&rsquo;s website.
                      Students look at additional poems for themes, inspiration
                      and ideas. Although exemplars provide ideas, I caution
                      students about mimicking a previous winning poem:
                      &ldquo;Your poem should be uniquely yours.&rdquo; I remind
                      students that poems will be judged on originality. The
                      goal of the discussion is to remind them of their writing
                      toolbox and inspire creativity.

                        that interests, inspires or intrigues them. I reference

                        to remind me of short assignments. It reminds me that
                        all I have to do is to write down as much as I can see
                        through a one-inch picture frame. This is all I have to
                        bite off for the time being.&rdquo;</font

                      After choosing a topic, students share ideas and
                      brainstorm. &ldquo;Just brainstorm and freewrite about
                      your topic. What does your topic smell, sound, taste like?
                      What connections can you make between your topic and your
                      own life? What stories could you tell? What do you want
                      the purpose of your poem to be?&rdquo; Students discuss
                      their theme using sensory details and stylistic devices.

                      Then, I prompt them to plan a structure for their poem. We
                      make a list on the board of how to incorporate a
                      structure: number of lines in each stanza, a repeated line
                      or phrase, number of syllables in each line (or pattern of
                      syllables), shape, headings or subtitles, theme,
                      punctuation, pattern, rhyme, repetition. Students also
                      share what structures were used in previous winning poems.
                      They write first and second drafts of poems, peer edit,
                      receive feedback from me, and continue to polish and
                      perfect. Additionally, students take turns sharing drafts
                      with the class and in small groups.

                      Students enjoy creating their own story and structure.
                      They also appreciate the opportunity to write for an
                      authentic audience and writers&rsquo; market. As the
                      standards say, students &ldquo;appreciate nuances, such as
                      how the composition of an audience should affect tone when
                      speaking and how the connotations of words affect

                      Winning students join Hedderman for a poetry reading and
                      workshop held at the Museum on a Saturday in May. The
                      workshop lasts about 45 minutes, and the students are
                      given an opportunity to read their poems for each other
                      and answer questions. Hedderman gives them feedback on
                      what they accomplished and why their poems won, while the
                      other students discuss what they liked in each
                      other&rsquo;s work. After a short break, family and
                      friends join the students for the reading. Hedderman
                      introduces each poem with his commentary. A PowerPoint
                      accompanies the reading, and features images that support
                      the subject of each poem as the student reads it. Each
                      student winner is awarded a complimentary one-year family
                      membership to the Museum.

                      Joey said, &ldquo;I thought it was fun to submit my work,
                      and the award ceremony was fun to go to. It doesn&rsquo;t
                      take long to submit, and winning can bring tons of fun
                      experiences...Another parent, a stranger to me, actually
                      talked to me about my piece after the reading and that was
                      really cool to me. I thought it was cool to listen to what
                      Richard thought was best about our poems. He pointed out
                      things in other people&rsquo;s poems that I didn&rsquo;t
                      notice at first...It was just a really fun
                      experience.&rdquo;

                      Andrea said, &ldquo;I got so nervous to read it in front
                      of everyone, but at the end of it, I realized it
                      wasn&rsquo;t half bad and I felt accomplished.&rdquo;
                      Andrea says this to teachers who are considering having
                      students submit: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely worth it.
                      Teachers should encourage their students to just have fun
                      with it.&rdquo;

                      If for a moment you imagine language as a length of rope,
                      a poem forms when you start tying knots in the rope and
                      pulling them tight, snugging them and squeezing all the
                      air out. The poet may then submit to the reader that his
                      imagination run over the knots like fingers over a set of
                      prayer beads. I don&rsquo;t know if Nancy Takacs knows
                      this, but she knows this. And her new volume of poetry,
                      <i>The Worrier</i>, is an astonishing collection studded
                      with miraculous knots of imagery and revelation as
                      startling and delicate as bird tracks in the snow.

                      Each poem in the book is titled &ldquo;The Worrier,&rdquo;
                      with a subtitle appended that carefully focuses it. The
                      poems are arranged in a question/answer pattern in which
                      an unidentified speaker questions the poet who responds in

                      Very quickly, I suspect, readers of
                      <i>The Worrier</i> will identify this structure as
                      catechism, a call and response learning ritual, an ancient
                      model of teaching through rhythm and the emphatic
                      declaration of belief.

                      We are likely to imagine at first glance that the title
                      refers to worry in the quotidian sense: anxiety,
                      perseverance over looming problems or pending catastrophe.
                      On one level, the structure of the book replicates worry
                      itself; the repeated title is a loop the mind follows as
                      it worries, flowing from internal to personal, to
                      external, global and existential. But we quickly
                      understand that a subtler reading is demanded.

                      The poet has invited us to observe as she parses the many

                      unravel&mdash;to <i>try </i>or <i>worry </i>out of
                      them&mdash;a central comprehension: What is it that
                      makes&mdash;and keeps&mdash;us alive? According to one
                      reading of the poems in <i>The Worrier</i>, one answer is
                      resilience in the face of human mystery, from which
                      emerges an unending challenge to what we take as truth.

                      This is ritual dialogue that transcends skin, bone and
                      brain, leaving the reader with a query of his own. From
                      where do the questions emerge? Are these questions she is
                      asking herself, or is a numinous, secondary voice probing
                      her understanding, involving us in her explorations of a
                      universal self? The answers challenge the questions, and
                      the reader is urged to decide just how welcome these
                      demanding and unforgiving voices truly are

                      relationship to its owner, and our inseparable communion
                      with the natural world that contains, embraces and labors,
                      ultimately, to undo it. This is the essential mortal

                      When I first arrived in the Milwaukee area in the late
                      summer of 2003, the Brewers were in the cellar and it was
                      going to be a few seasons before they clawed their way

                      I was raised in upstate New York, and lived for many years
                      in and near Boston. Nonetheless, until I moved to this
                      area, I didn&rsquo;t follow baseball; aside from a stint
                      in Little League, it had just never truly made it onto my
                      radar and stayed there.

                      Fran Tarkentan&rsquo;s tenure. Oddly, through some arcane
                      fluke I can no longer explain, I was also a Packers fan
                      and followed them closely during the Lombardi dynasty and
                      the years of the power sweep.

                      a house precisely 2.97 miles from Miller Park, I decided

                      The first Brewers game I ever attended was on a Tuesday
                      night in September of &lsquo;03. I was standing in line at
                      Miller Park waiting to buy a ticket about a half hour
                      before first pitch. As noted, the Brewers weren&rsquo;t
                      lighting up the scoreboard at this juncture, so the line
                      was short. I heard a voice ask if I needed a ticket for
                      the game. I turned and saw an elderly man looking at me.
                      He was tall, a little stooped and wore a three-piece white
                      suit. His hair was just a shade lighter than the suit. I
                      told him I was waiting to buy a ticket and he said,
                      &ldquo;Here. Take this. Enjoy the game,&rdquo; and handed
                      me a ticket for that evening&rsquo;s match-up against the
                      Pirates.

                      When I turned from examining the ticket to thank him, he
                      was gone. Poof. Vanished. He had disappeared like a wisp
                      of fog. I didn&rsquo;t know who he was, and I still
                      don&rsquo;t. I have no idea. He could have been my
                      Guardian Angel, the Angel of Death, the Archangel or the
                      Wizard of Oz. I don&rsquo;t know, but he gave me a ticket
                      to my first Brewers game and promptly disappeared.

                      something deeply mystical and numinous about baseball, and
                      if you are worthy, now and again its secrets may be
                      revealed, and its blessings bestowed upon you.

                      Most of my family still lives in and around Albany. For
                      them, going to see the Yankees or a Red Sox game at Fenway
                      bears all the challenges of a large-scale amphibious
                      assault complete with transportation problems, logistical
                      snafus, extended supply lines and a vast outlay of
                      treasure. A family of four traveling from Albany to take
                      in a Yankees game can spend hundreds of dollars for
                      tickets, gas, tolls, parking and food. You could just as
                      easily take the family to the Bahamas for a week and throw
                      in a side cruise out of Nassau. Then there&rsquo;s the

                      On a recent Sunday, with the Brewers on the road, I

                      game coming up in the middle of the week. I commonly will
                      only attend one or two such games each season, and it

                      had, which turned out to be an eight dollar ticket in
                      Bernie&rsquo;s Bleachers. She explained that the game fell
                      during the early season &ldquo;Spring Madness&rdquo;
                      promotion in which any ticket priced $38 or less was
                      offered at a 50% discount. Thus, she would charge me four
                      dollars for my ticket.

                      It was a Friday evening, and I was working a family event
                      at the Milwaukee Public Museum where I&rsquo;m the
                      Education Programs Coordinator. Visitors were there to
                      enjoy the museum and spend the night camping out on the
                      exhibit floors. A small boy, maybe about six years old,
                      walked up to me trailing his parents. His face reflected
                      intense concern. He wanted to know if he could ask me a
                      question. &ldquo;Shoot,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Are the
                      mummies scary when they come alive at night?&rdquo; he
                      asked. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re

                      about to let it escape me. I continued to elaborate
                      spectacularly on the subject. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
                      scary at all,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re just
                      loud.&rdquo; The boy gulped, and his face turned the color
                      of oatmeal. Yesterday&rsquo;s oatmeal. &ldquo;You
                      see,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re really just
                      looking for companionship. They&rsquo;ve become so
                      deprived of human connection after centuries in the tomb
                      that they&rsquo;re starved for company, and just looking
                      for a little conversation. So, they&rsquo;ll carry on
                      moaning and groaning, trying to get your attention. They
                      might follow you around for awhile, they might even tap
                      you on the shoulder or wake you up in the middle of the
                      night and try to get you play checkers or something, but
                      no, they&rsquo;re not scary.&rdquo; By now, he looked like
                      he&rsquo;d just shaken hands with Jack the Ripper.

                      Ancient people all over the globe mummified their dead. In
                      fact, the Egyptians were not even the first to do it. That
                      was likely the Chinchorro people of what we now know as
                      Chile and Peru. They were mummifying their dead in the dry
                      air of the coastal desert about three thousand years
                      before the Egyptians even thought about it.

                      wrapped in toilet paper stumbling around and
                      trick-or-treating at Halloween. But I&rsquo;d bet none of
                      us have ever seen a kid dressed for Halloween as a
                      Chinchorro mummy. That&rsquo;s because of all the ancient
                      cultures that mummified their dead, the Egyptians were the
                      virtuosos, and a well-preserved mummy from ancient Egypt
                      is a master-work of the form.

                      Napoleon knew this, and sent mummies back to France during
                      his disastrous military campaign in Egypt in the late
                      18<sup>th</sup> century, generating our modern interest in
                      them. By the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century, mummies were
                      trending. Very much a thing to have if you wished to
                      project an air of cultural adventurism, many well-to-do
                      Europeans brought mummies back from Egypt or sent for
                      them. It was common to hold &ldquo;unrollings,&rdquo; as
                      they were called, where guests were invited to watch as
                      the mummy was unwrapped&mdash;or
                      &ldquo;unrolled&rdquo;&mdash;just out of curiosity, just
                      to see what they looked like under the bandages.

                      particularly destructive to the mummy. Once unwrapped, a
                      mummy may never again be wrapped back up in the same way,
                      and thus a great deal of its archaeological matter is
                      lost.

                      A source of enduring mystery, mummies have long been
                      thought to bear a powerful life force. Since at least the
                      Middle Ages, apothecaries ground mummies into powder
                      which, added to various concoctions, were cheerfully
                      peddled as miracle cures well into the 19<sup>th</sup>

                      made up in morbid curiosity what it utterly lacked in

                      anniversary of the discovery of the tomb of the most
                      famous mummy in history, King Tutankhamun. Discovered by
                      British archaeologist, Howard Carter, in 1922, it was the
                      first tomb of an ancient Egyptian royal found in modern
                      times intact, meaning that all the stuff interred with the
                      pharaoh in 1352 BCE&mdash;over eight thousand individual
                      objects&mdash;was still in there when Carter and his team
                      opened it. If mummies hadn&rsquo;t already been popular by
                      then, they would have gotten popular very quickly.
                      Tut&rsquo;s mummy has enjoyed a rather spirited second
                      life, and has generated an entire subculture He&rsquo;s

                      him just for the experience, just to get nose-to-nose with
                      somebody who lived and died in Egypt over two thousand
                      years ago. The smell was faintly musty like the inside of
                      an old steamer trunk maybe. It was the scent of mummy
                      dust, the smell of eternity.

                      Before I undertook my annual pilgrimages to this remote
                      hilltop monastery, I knew very about the Trappists. A
                      Catholic religious community of cloistered monastics, they
                      are a branch of the Benedictines formally known as the
                      &ldquo;Order of Cistercians of the Strict
                      Observance;&rdquo; that is to say strict observance of the
                      Rule of St. Benedict.

                      The Trappists emerged in the 11<sup>th</sup> century from
                      the Benedictine system under their own distinct identity.
                      Their name derives from an early Benedictine community, La
                      Trappe Abbey, in the French province of Normandy. Deeply
                      contemplative by rule and by practice, the order has

                      Thus, for the past nine hundred years, Trappist monks and
                      nuns have flourished, prayed and worked in common, living
                      by the labor of their hands. Indeed, the abiding Trappist
                      imperative is <i>ora et labora</i>&mdash;prayer and
                      work&mdash;two endeavors I vigorously duck during my
                      visits, deferring instead to the several dozen resident
                      experts in these noble pursuits.

                      Trappist monks first came to America from France in 1803,
                      and established a &ldquo;mother house&rdquo; in Kentucky
                      in 1848. This was Gethsemani Abbey where Thomas
                      Merton&mdash;the world&rsquo;s first, and thus far only,
                      modern Trappist celebrity&mdash;made his home. The
                      Trappist order now has communities of monks and nuns
                      throughout the world, and 16 monasteries in North America
                      alone. St. Joseph&rsquo;s was settled in 1950 by a group
                      of Belgian and French monks from Nova Scotia and Rhode
                      Island. In these rustic hills of central
                      Massachusetts&mdash;a spur of the sprawling Appalachian
                      chain&mdash;the monks cleared the land and built their
                      monastery themselves by hand with the guidance of local
                      contractors.

                      The monks of St. Joseph&rsquo;s follow a rigorous communal
                      timetable, known as <i>horarium</i>, meant to ensure that
                      the time given by God is not wasted, but in whichever way
                      necessary used in His service, whether for prayer, work,
                      meals, spiritual reading or even sleep. As a retreatant at
                      St. Joseph&rsquo;s for over 10 years, I&rsquo;ve done a
                      first-rate job of becoming expert in the meals and sleep
                      part, rarely missing an opportunity to indulge in either.

                      Though devout and contemplative, the monks of St. Joseph,
                      like all Trappists, are an industrious lot, beginning
                      their day at 3:00 am, and hustling into the chapel for
                      Vigils&mdash;a service of chanted prayer&mdash;at 3:30.
                      From there, it&rsquo;s a steady schedule of alternating
                      sessions of work and worship until lights out sometime
                      around 8:00 at night. Seven days a week.

                      Trappists rigorously follow a way of life that is at once
                      faithful to the archaic traditions of their order, and
                      likewise adaptive to modern life. Though cloistered, the
                      monk&rsquo;s of St. Joseph&rsquo;s keep up with the news.
                      They read the papers, listen to the radio and have been
                      known to avail themselves of the wonders of computer
                      technology. At least some among them appear to be sports
                      fans. I once saw an elderly monk removing a Yankees cap
                      before donning his robes for Vespers. (And this in Red Sox

                      It is also deeply rooted in the Benedictine tradition to
                      offer refuge to travelers, and most monasteries include a
                      retreat house where guest may stay for a week or weekend.
                      The humble visitor is expected to offer a monetary
                      donation in return according to his means, ample or
                      meager. Guest houses at Trappist monasteries feature 11
                      rooms so to avoid, it would appear, awkwardly echoing the
                      sacred number of 12. The house features a kitchen and
                      refectory, a comfortable parlor and its own chapel.

                      St. Benedict insisted on silence though, contrary to
                      popular belief, the Trappists do not exactly take a
                      <u>vow</u> of silence. Hours of strict silence are set,
                      and at other times silence is maintained as much as is
                      practically possible. In fact, a Trappist Sign Language is
                      used to render speaking superfluous. Social conversations
                      are limited, and a Trappist tends to speak only when
                      necessary; hard to imagine in our current climate of
                      obsessive volubility. Monks normally eat in contemplative
                      silence while listening as a single brother reads
                      spiritual texts from a lectern.

                      the work of their hands,&rdquo; and following this dictum,
                      Trappist monasteries produce an eclectic array of goods
                      which are sold to supplement their modest take from the
                      retreat house, and support a self-reliant life. Various of

                      the celebrated Trappist jams and jellies. It is said that,
                      shortly after St. Joseph&rsquo;s was established, a few of
                      the monks concocted a small stove-top batch of jelly from
                      a generous harvest of mint taken from the
                      monastery&rsquo;s herb garden. Monastic strictures at the
                      time forbade such delicacies, so it was sold to visitors

                      monastery gift shop&mdash;out on the main road. The
                      response was, as St. Joseph&rsquo;s official history puts
                      it, &ldquo;highly encouraging.&rdquo; Indeed, Trappist
                      jams are now sold worldwide and offered in abundance in

                      Historically, most of my fellow retreatants at St.

                      priests and monsignors, and once, by some odd chance, a

                      though it is named for St. Joseph, there are few if any
                      visible images of him. Indeed, though each of the 11 guest
                      rooms is named after one saint or another, none of them
                      bear the namesake of the monastery itself. On the
                      contrary, the Benedictines appear to be committed Marists,
                      and it is indeed Mary who seems to enjoy top billing, and
                      remains the focus of devotion. One is left to conclude
                      that, once the heavy lifting was accomplished, Joseph
                      finally became outstandingly superfluous.

                      After the midday meal, the broad, revenant swale of
                      afternoon is before us. One drifts wordlessly across
                      longitudes of silence. The retreat house and its
                      inhabitants fall into a tranquil, contemplative torpor. As
                      I quietly read in the deep afternoon light, or invite
                      sleep, the sky above our hilltop often stages dramatic
                      expositions of weather.

                      rooftops, and roaring like the breath of God shoved
                      through a needle. Gusts of heavy rain or billowing snow
                      and violent lashings of wind scour the hilltop, hurling
                      enormous volumes of towering cloud. In the spellbound
                      dusks, veils of snow unfurl and lay upon the hills like a

                      At 5:30 each evening, a brother leads us to Vespers, a
                      word sounding deliciously like &quot;whispers,&quot; and
                      deriving from the Latin for &quot;evening.&quot; We take a
                      winding path through the monastery complex, down a
                      labyrinth of passageways. We are lead quickly through a
                      library of massive bookcases stacked with tomes of an
                      ancient and inscrutable appearance that seem to bear upon
                      their spines the dust of centuries. There are vistas
                      through a series of arched, floor-to-ceiling windows of an
                      inner courtyard deep in snow. There are snow-bound statues
                      of the Virgin, and others too rimed with ice to recognize.
                      On clear nights, Venus burns ferociously in the deep ink
                      of winter sky, and Orion strides the southern horizon, his
                      trinity of belt stars blazing.

                      At last, we approach a back entrance to the chapel,
                      padding solemnly over polished stone floors gleaming
                      softly in the medieval light. Contrary to common belief it
                      is Compline, and not Vespers, that is the final service of
                      the monastic day. The word &ldquo;compline&rdquo; derives
                      from the Latin root meaning &quot;complete,&quot; and of
                      all the services in the Divine Office, it is my favorite.
                      The chapel is dimmed to the light of a single candle
                      suspended from the nave. Monks in pale robes chant. The
                      chapel is submerged in unbroken shadow, consuming the
                      fires of day, and assuaging the soul of the mystic, the
                      penitent, and the uncertain.

                      After dusk, night lowers swiftly. I sit by the light of a
                      single lamp and listen. If it is still, and the winds of
                      afternoon have fallen, the silence is immense and one can
                      sense the unreachable plains of the universe assembling
                      somewhere above. The wind that roared and boomed against
                      the chapel roof during Vespers has died and the great
                      bolts of snow have ebbed.

                      One night, as I lay drifting off, a pack of coyotes yipped
                      and howled somewhere beyond the walls of the retreat house
                      as they ranged the moonlit fields in utter disregard of
                      the monastic enclosure. So feral and unrestrained was
                      their exclamation, that hair rose on the back of my neck
                      and I dared not look out. For what I heard had in it
                      something beyond us: a savage lament for the undefined
                      terrain of the spirit, or perhaps just some primal salute
                      to the unknowable.

                      T.S. Eliot famously observed in his great poem, &ldquo;The
                      Four Quartets,&rdquo; that April is the cruelest month.
                      Economists quote this line every year during the first two
                      weeks of that month when referencing the climax of the
                      great American tax period. And so I suppose it&rsquo;s
                      ironic, that April is also National Poetry Month, poetry,
                      unlike the American tax code, being an endeavor without
                      rules or penalties. One never gets penalized for writing
                      bad poetry, thankfully.

                      Oddly, I&rsquo;ve never encountered anyone who has parsed
                      Eliot&rsquo;s line in the context of poetry itself. To
                      what was Eliot referring? I couldn&rsquo;t tell you.
                      I&rsquo;ve never been curious enough to sit and figure it
                      out and, let&rsquo;s face it, Eliot was a drip.

                    <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
                      The question of why I write poetry occasionally comes up
                      during National Poetry Month, and I find the reason can be
                      as difficult to decode as Eliot&rsquo;s line. Like so many
                      male poets before me (maybe even Eliot!), I started
                      writing poetry as a schoolboy out of one great desire: to
                      impress girls. I was convinced that girls liked poetry and
                      were fascinated by boys who wrote it. Write poetry, I
                      reasoned, and girls will flock to you like pigeons to a
                      statue.

                    <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
                      That&rsquo;s perhaps not the most successful image, but
                      the idea was that if I wrote poetry, girls would find me
                      fascinating; I&rsquo;d be the irresistible focus of their
                      attentions. Sometimes this worked fabulously. Most of the
                      time it didn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s OK; I liked poetry
                      anyway and stuck with it.

                      To begin with, I love poetry for its immediacy, its
                      promise of infinite surprise, its threat of immanent
                      combustion. And I like the compression, how in a poem the
                      entire universe can be packed into a single line. I like
                      how physical it is&mdash;it&rsquo;s compact and powerful
                      like the short, sharp jabs of the boxer. And yet it has an
                      astonishing fluidity: a poem can swim like a trout, plunge
                      like a cataract, heave and spill like an ocean wave. And
                      I&rsquo;m always fascinated by the sight of ink sinking
                      into the brilliant white flesh of the page as I write it.

                      I find it distinctly alchemical, wresting the everyday,
                      mundane ordinariness of life and casting it into
                      astonishing new forms&mdash;something that is magical,
                      lyrical, heroic, glorious and transformative. It&rsquo;s
                      without limit in subject or range; a poem can tackle
                      anything. And it&rsquo;s curative; poetry can calm,
                      console, cauterize and heal.

                      And I&rsquo;m also utterly taken with its persistent and
                      enthralling contradictions: a poem can kill two birds with
                      one stone or breathe life into the dead; it can bite like
                      salt or bind and soothe like a skein of silk.

                      another form, or doing something else like throwing pots
                      or playing the oboe. It&rsquo;s certainly not easy, and
                      it&rsquo;s not exactly what I&rsquo;d call fun. Sometimes
                      it is, but that doesn&rsquo;t keep me writing. I guess
                      it&rsquo;s just a good fit. It&rsquo;s a job that somehow
                      I like doing.

                                accepts the challenge. Saul, perhaps feeling a
                                bit shamed at this point, offers David his
                                armor, but David turns him down. He has other

                            wears his armor, and carries a sword and javelin.
                            David has his staff and sling and five stones from a
                            nearby stream. (Doesn&rsquo;t seem like much against
                            all that metal.) David gives Goliath a severe
                            dressing down in the name of the Lord, at which the
                            giant has a good laugh for himself. David hurls a
                            stone from his sling and hits Goliath square in the
                            center of the forehead, inflicting what we might
                            call a career-ending injury. Goliath falls to the
                            ground dead, and David cuts off his head. Problem
                            solved. Battle won. Go Israelites.</font

                          basically bringing a knife to a gunfight. Goliath
                          thinks he&rsquo;s going to stomp the shepherd&rsquo;s
                          guts out, but David&rsquo;s not having it. He knows
                          that in the hands of a skilled slinger, which he is, a
                          well-slung stone will do an awful lot of damage,
                          traveling as it may at about 130 miles an hour, or 190
                          feet per second. That&rsquo;s not as fast as a bullet,
                          but it&rsquo;s fast enough. Goliath didn&rsquo;t have
                          a chance. David, we might say, rocked it.</font
