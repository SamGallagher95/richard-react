Jorgensen teaches English at Arrowhead Union High School. Since 2008,
students in her junior- and senior-level Creative Writing classes
have submitted to the Milwaukee Public Museum&rsquo;s annual poetry
competition. Poet and essayist Richard Hedderman is the Education
Programs Coordinator at the Milwaukee Public Museum. He is the
Coordinator and Lead Judge for the Museum&rsquo;s annual Student
Poetry Competition. In this article, Hedderman, discusses his
approach to evaluating the poems as they&rsquo;re submitted, while
Jorgensen provides a classroom perspective.</P>

Looking for a way to energize my classroom with authentic writing
opportunities, I scour websites, newspapers and online announcements
for student-friendly writers&rsquo; markets. Although I could
formulate a hypothetical audience for my classroom writing
assignments, I find student motivation increases with authentic
opportunities. Having students submit to writers&rsquo; markets isn&rsquo;t
any more work than an assignment that stays in the classroom and
writers&rsquo; markets facilitate my pedagogical goals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
One Wisconsin-wide writers&rsquo; market is the Milwaukee Public
Museum&rsquo;s annual poetry competition. Now in its tenth year, the
competition is open to Wisconsin students in grades three through 12.
The competition fits naturally inside Wisconsin English or social
studies curricula as students are challenged to compose a poem in 30
lines or less as a response to the Museum&rsquo;s permanent or
temporary exhibits, collections or fields of research. 	</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Though poems are commonly submitted by English and language arts
teachers, this is not a requirement, and student work may be
submitted by the teachers of any subject. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
The Museum launched the program with its first competition in 2008.
Early the previous year, Museum staff were in the planning stages for
a traveling exhibition on the Titanic, and brainstorming ideas for
innovative programming to support it, when a brilliant and charming
Education staff member suggested a poetry competition for students.
So, that first year, the theme was &ldquo;the Titanic, ships and
shipwrecks,&rdquo; and hundreds of student poems poured in from
schools around the state. The winners were invited to read their
poems at the museum on May 18th that year, which is International
Museum Day, and a poster featuring their winning poems was displayed
in the exhibition for the remainder of its run. The program was a
success, and the Museum&rsquo;s Education Department adopted it as a
permanent feature of its regular education programming, engaging
students in the exploration of the Museum and its exhibits and
collections through the application of creative language arts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Subsequent themes continue to align closely with the Museum&rsquo;s
exhibits and collections. The year following the Titanic competition,
the theme was &ldquo;Excavating the Soul&mdash;the Poetry of
Archaeology,&rdquo; which connected with the Museum&rsquo;s first
hosting of the Milwaukee chapter of the Archaeological Institute of
America&rsquo;s archaeology fair. The next year, the traveling
exhibition, &ldquo;Mummies of the World,&rdquo; inspired a number of
wonderful student poems. The theme &ldquo;Objects and Artifacts&mdash;the
Poetry of the Museum&rsquo;s Collections,&rdquo; spanned both the
2012 and 2013 competitions owing to the richness of the Museum&rsquo;s
collections. Students were encouraged to choose a favorite or
interesting object on exhibit during a visit to the museum, or select
one from a virtual collection of the Museum&rsquo;s artifacts and
specimens available online. Subsequent themes included &ldquo;journeys,&rdquo;
&ldquo;animals,&rdquo; &ldquo;ancient worlds,&rdquo; and &ldquo;food,&rdquo;
among others.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
The competition&rsquo;s theme may change each year, but the students&rsquo;
poems should always display creativity and originality, and reflect
the authenticity and history of their topic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
In 2018, the Museum will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the
competition and, according to the museum&rsquo;s webpage, the theme
for 2017-2018 is &ldquo;10 at MPM,&rdquo; which focuses on &ldquo;ten
iconic exhibits that highlight the Museum, its collections, and
mission, and celebrate its legacy as one of the region&rsquo;s most
treasured cultural institutions.&rdquo; The ten exhibits are the
Hebior Mammoth, Humpback Whale Skeleton, Streets of Old Milwaukee,
Butterfly Vivarium, Hell Creek, Native American Pow Wow, Crow Indian
Bison Hunt, Masai Lion Hunt, Crossroads of Civilization, and Japanese
House and Garden.

&ldquo;authentic writing implies that the student is writing in his
or her voice to a real living person or group about a matter of
concern.&rdquo; And not only does the Museum assignment motivate
students to write for an audience and analyze other poems for
structure and meaning, but the competition also aligns with the
Wisconsin State and Common Core standards. Specifically, the standard
on Production and Distribution of Writing states students should
&ldquo;produce clear and coherent writing in which the development,
organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and
audience...develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning,
revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach&hellip;[and]
use technology, including the Internet, to produce and publish
writing and to interact and collaborate with others.&rdquo; </FONT>

poetry competition provides students with authenticity across grade
levels. </FONT>

Additional standards&mdash;including Conventions of Standard,
Knowledge of Language and Vocabulary Acquisition and Use&mdash;are
also met throughout the writing and editing process. As Wiggins
wrote, &ldquo;The point is to open the mind or heart of a real
audience&mdash;create a fuss, achieve a feeling, start some
thinking.&rdquo; I remind my students of this when we discuss the
judging criteria.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Void of a rubric, students&rsquo; poems are &ldquo;judged on
creativity, originality, imagery, artistic quality, and sense of
poetic expression.&rdquo; But what do these terms mean? To begin, I
have students read the contest guidelines and create their own
definitions of the judging criteria. Students connect &ldquo;imagery&rdquo;
to showing, instead of telling. They define &ldquo;artistic quality&rdquo;
as &ldquo;how a poem is like art.&rdquo; Students agree effective art
evokes an emotion and makes the viewer (or in this case, reader)
think or feel differently. Creativity, students decide, is something
that makes one submission stand out from the others, and students
surmise that of the hundreds of statewide submissions, theirs will
need to not only address the theme, but also be original. Throughout
the discussion, I jot down notes for students to access later. This
discussion helps them form an imaginary guideline of their own. &nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
To further guide the writing process, students read and analyze
previous winning poems, noting commonalities and how the poems fit
the judging criteria.

I ask the students what they notice. &ldquo;There is a story,&rdquo;
one student says. We discuss how Suhan drew inspiration from a museum
artifact (Dresden Tete-a-Tete Tea Set) and used her own creativity
and voice to tell an original story that fits with the authenticity
of the artifact.

&ldquo;Porcelain Deathbed.&rdquo; Another student says she notices
&ldquo;interesting language choices.&rdquo; I push for specifics and

assignment, students learn to identify stylistic devices and
purposeful writing choices in exemplars and utilize them in their own
work.

&ldquo;Her structure is strong,&rdquo; another student says. Students

and the fish swishing its tail around the sunken Titanic. &ldquo;This

<FONT COLOR="#000000">Truly, the first thing I look at when
evaluating a poem submitted to the competition is how it is framed,
formatted and presented. So, there&rsquo;s a responsibility incumbent
on the teacher to be very attentive to the submission guidelines. I
need to see the student&rsquo;s name, the teacher&rsquo;s name, grade
level taught, and his or her full contact information in the top
right corner of the page. If I don&rsquo;t see that, my confidence in
the poem plummets before I&rsquo;ve even read it. And colored paper,
illustrations and decorative fonts are just distracting, and never do
anything to make the poem more appealing or more likely to win. And
if the poem is longer than 30 lines, you&rsquo;ve lost me before I
even read it, which I may not do. This might all seem a little fussy
and bureaucratic, but it&rsquo;s critical; it tells me how much care
has been put into the submission. If the teachers and students don&rsquo;t
care intensely about the work, then neither will I.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Once I&rsquo;m into the poem, I want to see
structure, in some form. I want a sense from the poem that it has
been </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>crafted</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
that it bears the consciousness of the writer who has invested it
with meaning and focus. Interesting or fun words on the page won&rsquo;t
make a poem; structure does. So, I&rsquo;m looking for evidence that
the writer has thought hard about how the words should go together to
give the poem weight and power. It&rsquo;s common for some to think
that creativity equals sloppiness, which is a very poor argument.
Creativity may be the impulse behind the poem&mdash;and that impulse
can, and probably should be, sloppy, messy and disorganized. But
structure reflects craft, and craft gives the poem meaning and
impact. That&rsquo;s what makes it art.</FONT></P>

I don&rsquo;t like poems that just stop. I need to see a thoughtful,
moving, well-crafted ending. Otherwise, I get the impression that the
writer just walked away from his poem instead of putting in the work
necessary to make it a cohesive and integrated work of art. Yeats
said that a good poem &ldquo;comes right with a click like a closing
box&rdquo; (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#222222"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Warwick

I like a poem that tells me something I don&rsquo;t already know&mdash;not
in the sense of a fact, exactly, but an emotion, observation,
comparison, perspective. I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of student poems
composed of a list of facts about the subject. This won&rsquo;t
disqualify a poem, but the list of facts need something unusual,
something innovative&mdash;a twist&mdash;something the poet is
telling me about his relationship with them that I can&rsquo;t find
by just googling &ldquo;the Titanic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;mummies,&rdquo;
for example. I&rsquo;ll also give a poem a lot of credit for a bit of
humor. Poetry doesn&rsquo;t have to be serious all the time, and
certainly doesn&rsquo;t need to be serious to be good. I really
appreciate a laugh in a poem. &ldquo;Crummy Mummy,&rdquo; is a great
example of a funny, successful poem.</FONT></P>

Each of these is a winning poem from the competition. Note the

easy to do, but when a student writer accomplishes it in a poem, that
poem goes immediately to the top of my &ldquo;potential&rdquo; pile,
as opposed to the top of the &ldquo;nope&rdquo; pile. And I like to
see poems that stay linked to their theme&mdash;and to the writer&rsquo;s
voice, emotion and impulse&mdash;all the way through, something else
that&rsquo;s tough to do. For me, the poem has to hang together and
stay together. A poem needs a spine&mdash;a through-line, an
adherence to theme&mdash;that its various parts attach to so that it
stays together as a coherent, artistic unit. Again, this is not easy.
Not for professional poets, let alone students who are maybe trying

After we collaboratively analyze previous winning poems, I provide
students independent work time to immerse themselves in the MPM
Poetry Competition&rsquo;s website. Students look at additional poems
for themes, inspiration and ideas. Although exemplars provide ideas,
I caution students about mimicking a previous winning poem: &ldquo;Your
poem should be uniquely yours.&rdquo; I remind students that poems
will be judged on originality. The goal of the discussion is to
remind them of their writing toolbox and inspire creativity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Once students understand the purpose and
background of this assignment, they decide on a topic that coincides
with that year&rsquo;s theme. Students choose something that
interests, inspires or intrigues them. I reference an excerpt from
Anne Lamott&rsquo;s </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>Bird By Bird</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
we read earlier in the semester: &ldquo;I go back to trying to
breathe, slowly and calmly, and I finally notice the one-inch picture
frame that I put on my desk to remind me of short assignments. It
reminds me that all I have to do is to write down as much as I can
see through a one-inch picture frame. This is all I have to bite off
for the time being.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do too much. Don&rsquo;t take on everything all at
once. Start small,&rdquo; I say.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
After choosing a topic, students share ideas and brainstorm. &ldquo;Just
brainstorm and freewrite about your topic. What does your topic
smell, sound, taste like? What connections can you make between your
topic and your own life? What stories could you tell? What do you
want the purpose of your poem to be?&rdquo; Students discuss their
theme using sensory details and stylistic devices.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Then, I prompt them to plan a structure for their poem. We make a
list on the board of how to incorporate a structure: number of lines
in each stanza, a repeated line or phrase, number of syllables in
each line (or pattern of syllables), shape, headings or subtitles,
theme, punctuation, pattern, rhyme, repetition. Students also share
what structures were used in previous winning poems. They write first
and second drafts of poems, peer edit, receive feedback from me, and
continue to polish and perfect. Additionally, students take turns
sharing drafts with the class and in small groups.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Students enjoy creating their own story and structure. They also
appreciate the opportunity to write for an authentic audience and
writers&rsquo; market. As the standards say, students &ldquo;appreciate
nuances, such as how the composition of an audience should affect
tone when speaking and how the connotations of words affect meaning.&rdquo;</P>

Joey Hassler, a junior in my Creative Writing class, said, &ldquo;I

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Another student, Andrea Beaudry, a junior, said, &ldquo;Regardless of
winning or not, each piece tells its very own story. I think that
[students] should not feel pressured or think about the prize, but
let the words flow. When you peacefully write something it ends up
being a lot better then if you were stressed out trying to make it
the best.&rdquo;</P>

Winning students join Hedderman for a poetry reading and workshop
held at the Museum on a Saturday in May. The workshop lasts about 45
minutes, and the students are given an opportunity to read their
poems for each other and answer questions. Hedderman gives them
feedback on what they accomplished and why their poems won, while the
other students discuss what they liked in each other&rsquo;s work.
After a short break, family and friends join the students for the
reading. Hedderman introduces each poem with his commentary. A
PowerPoint accompanies the reading, and features images that support
the subject of each poem as the student reads it. Each student winner
is awarded a complimentary one-year family membership to the Museum.</P>

award ceremony was fun to go to. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to
submit, and winning can bring tons of fun experiences...Another
parent, a stranger to me, actually talked to me about my piece after
the reading and that was really cool to me. I thought it was cool to
listen to what Richard thought was best about our poems. He pointed
out things in other people&rsquo;s poems that I didn&rsquo;t notice
at first...It was just a really fun experience.&rdquo;</P>
