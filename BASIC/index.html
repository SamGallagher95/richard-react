                      In The Discovery of Heaven, Hedderman's poems move like
                      meditation as he considers those things in his life worth
                      pausing for, worth his contemplation. Juxtaposing the
                      mythological and the literary against the concrete images
                      of the everyday—of horses and wolves, stones and avocados,
                      birches and even television—he creates his own mythology,
                      a world where his words are strong and beautiful, and his
                      stunning imagery is rich with detail and music. The reader
                      is taken to a place he didn't expect to go, a place I want
                      to return to—often.

                    <p>
                      Each poem in Choosing a Stone offers both the simplicity
                      and the intricacy of natural things Richard Hedderman is
                      drawn to, such as stones, owls, wolves, snow, ice,
                      flowers, and birches. His brilliant writing is both
                      concise and concentric, like that steelhead he sees caught
                      and released, revealing nature's glint and muscle, a rare
                      moment, ephemeral but here, as the poet shows us what is
                      hidden or not often noticed: the beauty in being. His
                      words always bring me closer to being myself. Questioning
                      an afterlife, the poet see his own heaven as " . . . a
                      place/to lie down in for an hour/with the long summer sun
                      on our faces,/amid the drone of bees in a tended garden. .
                      . I am reminded of Thoreau's attention to the minute
                      details and elevation of the natural world, which gives
                      our lives meaning, and his belief that a life well-lived
                      is one that chooses only what is essential.
